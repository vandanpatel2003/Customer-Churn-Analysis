# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
Customer churn analysis helps businesses understand why customers leave and how to improve retention. This project analyzes customer data to identify churn patterns, define key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualize insights using Power BI.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing values, data transformations, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and patterns in customer behavior.
- **Business Recommendations**: Data-driven suggestions to improve customer retention.


### Sample Columns:
- `CustomerID`
- `Department`
- `Phone service`
- `Payment mode`
- `Total_Charges`
- `Churn` (Yes/No)

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For data analysis and modeling)


## Business Insights
- **High churn rate observed in customers with short subscription durations.**
- **Customers with higher monthly charges tend to churn more.**
- **Loyalty programs and better customer support may reduce churn.**

## Future Improvements
- Deploying the model as an API for real-time predictions.
- Enhancing feature engineering with external data sources.
- Implementing advanced ML models like XGBoost or Neural Networks.
